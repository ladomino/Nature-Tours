# Nature Tours Application

## Description
Nature Tours is an app built using Node.js, ExpressJS, Mongoose and MongoDB.

It is a Udemy bootcamp course specifically designed to go over Node, Express, Mongoose and MongoDB indepth functionality while building an application using
everything learned.

The course also reviews complete coding techniques.  

Techniques include:  
1.  Using a RESTFUL API
2.  MVC architecture
3.  Query String Handling
4.  Data Aggregation
5.  Express Middleware
6.  Mongoose Middleware - Document, Query and Aggregate functions.
7.  JSON Web Tokens for Authentication
8.  Authorization, user roles, and protected routes
9.  Error Handling Layer for Development vs Production and Express, Mongooose and
    general handling.  A necessity for any developer to know how to do this.
10.  Testing out everything on PostMan.
11. Using NDB Debugger.
12. Setting up MongoDB Locally and on Atlas.
13. Using MongoDB Command Terminal and Compass and on Atlas.


Once the app is completed it will be deployed on Heroku and use Mongo Atlas for
the MongoDB.   Setup for MongoDB can either be Locally or on Mongo Atlas.  I did both and the course easily explained how to switch.
